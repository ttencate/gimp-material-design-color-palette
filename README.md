Material Design color palette for GIMP
======================================

We have been loving the color palette that Google has prescribed for its [Material Design language](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). However we realized that we couldn't find a readymade palette that we can use in GIMP / Inkscape.

So we at [KiSSFLOW](http://kissflow.com) created one for the community. Download the file and import it as a Palette in GIMP and then you are good to go.

It is also compatible with the [ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/palettes.html) extension.

How To
======

## GIMP

(Tested on 2.8.2)

Open the Palettes window with: `Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Palettes`. Once opened, click on `configure this tab` on the top right corner of the new window and select `Palettes Menu > Import Palette...`. Select the option `Palette file` and choose the downloaded file [Material-Design.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiSSFLOW/gimp-material-design-color-palette/master/Material-Design.gpl).

## Inkscape

(Tested on 0.92)

On Linux (Debian 3.2) copy the file [Material-Design.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiSSFLOW/gimp-material-design-color-palette/master/Material-Design.gpl) into `/usr/share/inkscape/palettes/` (for a system-wide installation) or `~/.config/inkscape/palettes/` (for your user account only), and then (re)launch Inkscape.
